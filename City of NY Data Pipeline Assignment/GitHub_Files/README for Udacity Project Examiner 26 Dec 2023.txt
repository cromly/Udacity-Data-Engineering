Dear Examiner

I successfully completed all this project's activities.
You will find all the screenshots in the Assignments_Screenshots directory.

Please note the following:

(1) I understood that I had to complete the Data Aggregation Data Flow activity within the Azure Synapse Environment.
Therefore, if you are looking for these Data Flow objects you will not find it in the GitHub repository since it only has the objects from the work I have done in Azure Data Factory.

(2) Please note that I have two Synapse Workspaces, the first was built in South Africa region but the IR would not run to debug the Data Flows and the Pipelines.
Therefore I had to create a second Synapse Workspace in the Western Europe region to get a working IR again.
